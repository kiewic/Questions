Questions
=========

Questions is an app to keep you up to date with the latest questions from the Stack Exchange network, including websites like StackOverflow.com, SuperUser.com and ServerFault.com.

You define what websites you are interested on and you can narrow the results by choosing tags for each website. E.g.: If you choose StackOverflow.com, you may choose C# and C++11 tags, so you only see questions related to C# and C++11.

Programming and computers are not the only available topics, there are more topics like travels, cooking, games, languages, mathematics, history, politics, etc.

Note: You must be familiar with Stack Exchange tags. Not every word or sentence is a valid Stack Exchange tag. For a complete list of available tags, visit: http://stackoverflow.com/tags
